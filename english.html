					<p class="history__content_p1">The history of the web developer profession began in 1990, when the British inventor Tim Berners-Lee introduced the world to the revolutionary World Wide Web project, in which he developed the first website. From that moment on, technologies began to develop rapidly, and a few years later there was a full-fledged Mosaic browser, HTML markup language, CSS cascading style sheets, JavaScript, C and . For some time, there was no single syntax, which caused difficulties in the work of programmers.</p><br>
            		<p class="history__content_p2">A breakthrough in this industry was the emergence of the PHP scripting language. With its help, web pages have turned from static texts into dynamic images with buttons, forms, animations. Beautiful and user-friendly sites began to be popular.</p><br>
            		<p class="history__content_p3">Not only large corporations, but also ordinary users wanted to have their own page on the Internet. Over the past 30 years, the IT industry has become one of the leading ones, and web developers have been required in various areas: from Internet marketing to artificial intelligence.</p><br>

					<h4>Specialist levels:</h4>
					<p class="salary__content"><b>Junior</b> - knows programming languages and writes simple working code that is checked by senior colleagues. Little experience - 0-1.5 years. While he does not represent the entire development process, he performs the received tasks.</p>
					<p class="salary__content"><b>Middle</b> - experience 1-3 years. Usually there are projects that I did completely on my own. Can develop without superfluous control, knows the best practices of their languages. Able to check and correct someone else's code.</p>
					<p class="salary__content"><b>Senior</b> - experience from 4 years, but experience is more important. He sees the development from the point of view of all participants: from managers to junior colleagues. Able to offer global solutions - for example, changing the set (stack) of technologies.

					<h3>Perspective for the profession</h3>
					<img class="prospects__img" src="img/perspective.png" alt="images">
					<p class="prospects__content_p1">A There are three types of people. The first ones are blamed for the fact that, without a hitch, a piece of intelligence sits in a working place and helps to earn a living, others - they don’t get it, if the neural networks are found to start doing all the routine work for them, to dedicate their lives to more busywork. And the third one understands that the replacement of human work with machine work is an inevitable process, but if it’s possible to deprive someone of them without a job, then it’s definitely not them, people, like programmers behind the fah.

					
			</p><br>
					<p class="prospects__content_p2">The rest of us are so afraid of clerks, even if everything goes to the point where, without a hitch, people in corporations can replace a programmer, who will serve the neuromeasurement, which is built up to self-training that self-perfection.
Powerful gadgets will help all the greater number of programmers, and further their numbers will only grow</p>
